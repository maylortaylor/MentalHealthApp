1,What's going on?,"There is no emotion without thoughts.
Ask yourself, what am I thinking about 
that's causing this emotional disturbance?
What is the activating event that led to this
thought?","Ask yourself, What's happening that triggered you?",https://vimeo.com/parrinstitute/creatingdepression
2,Where is your 'Need?',"Depression only happens when we tell ourselves that we ""NEED"" something in
order to be happy. But we don't feel 
depression if we stop right there, we 
slowly create the state of depression when
we also believe that we are ""HELPLESS"" 
and ""HOPELESS"" to attain that ""NEED""
",Let's start by identifying the NEED in your thinking here in this section.,https://vimeo.com/parrinstitute/realneeds
3,Is it truly hopeless?,"Is it true that there you are hopeless? Are 
there any scenarios in which the need is 
attainable? What action steps could be 
taken to move you closer to the need?
",Is it completely 100% true that you are totally hopeless in this situation?,
4,Are you truly helpless,"Is it true that there you are helpless? Are 
there any scenarios in which the need is 
attainable? What action steps could be 
taken to move you closer to the need?
",Is there anything that you can do that would bring close to where you want to be?,
5,Radical Acceptance," There are some cases that the 'need'
is truly impossible, in that case we must 
ask ourselves, do we truly ""need"" this
thing to be happy, or do we merely ""want""
it really badly? There is a huge emotional 
difference between ""desiring"" something,
and ""demanding"" it. Is there anything else
that could make you happy? Is there a 
bigger purpose to your life besides this
""one thing""?

6,Breathe like your life depends on it.,"The 4 Blocks Breath is a breathing technique to help you release negative emotions and physiological sensations. 
Forcing yourself to breathe deeply will ‘hack’ your body into feeling calmer. You may find it difficult to breathe 
deeply at first because your chest is tight and your muscles are constricted, but the deeper you breathe, the
 more your body will relax. The act of counting the breaths helps the pattern become symettrical and gradually 
deeper, watch how with the video button on the top right of this card. 

Remember: Breath is the King of the Mind. If you want to take back control of your mind, 
it starts by taking control of your breath.

7,Remember to SOS,"Always remember SOS - self, others, and
the situation. Accept your SELF as you are,
accept the OTHERS, and accept the
SITUATION to the best of your ability. ","Self - In what ways am I rejecting or not accepting aspects of my 'Self'? 
How would it look and feel to forgive and accept yourself fully?

Others - In what ways am I rejecting or not accepting 'Other people or events'?
What are some of the reasons that other people might have done what they did?

Situation - In what ways am I rejecting or not accepting my 'Situation' (circumstances)
Is complaining about the situatino helping? Is it 100% hopeless? Is there anything that can be done to improve the situation?",
8,How are you feeling now?,"Think about how you feel now compared to before disputing and breathing. I'm willing to bet it's significantly better, and yet, maybe there's still more. Repeat this process with every block, with every situation that bothers you that you can think of, and do these exercises as many days in a row as you can, and you will gradually steer your life into an entirely new upward spiral. ",Notice the connection between beliefs and how you feel. How do you feel after reframing some of those painful beliefs?,
