a 'what if' scenario. This is your brain
acting out of self-preservation, it's just
trying to keep you safe! We only start to 
feel stress when we believe in, and dwell
on, the what-if scenario. Once we believe
it's a fact, we then add then ruminate
on how 'awful' it is, until you tell yourself:
'I can't stand it."" ",Let's now identify the specific 'What-if' scenarios that you are telling yourself.,https://vimeo.com/parrinstitute/anxietyformula

6,Breathe Like Your Life Depends On It,"The 4 Blocks Breath is a breathing technique to help you release negative emotions and physiological sensations. Forcing yourself to breathe deeply will ‘hack’ your body into feeling calmer. You may find it difficult to breathe deeply at first because your chest is tight and your muscles are constricted, but the deeper you breathe, the more your body will relax.

7,Remember to SOS ,"Always remember SOS - self, others, and
the situation. Accept your SELF as you are,
accept the OTHERS, and accept the
SITUATION to the best of your ability. ","Self - In what ways am I rejecting or not accepting aspects of my 'Self'? 
How would it look and feel to forgive and accept yourself fully?

Others - In what ways am I rejecting or not accepting 'Other people or events'?
What are some of the reasons that other people might have done what they did?

Situation - In what ways am I rejecting or not accepting my 'Situation' (circumstances)
Is complaining about the situatino helping? Is it 100% hopeless? Is there anything that can be done to improve the situation?",
8,How do you feel now?,"Think about how you feel now compared to before disputing and breathing. I'm willing to bet it's significantly better, and yet, maybe there's still more. Repeat this process with every block, with every situation that bothers you that you can think of, and do these exercises as many days in a row as you can, and you will gradually steer your life into an entirely new upward spiral.
