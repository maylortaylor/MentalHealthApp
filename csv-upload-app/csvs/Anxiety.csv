1,What's going on?,"There is no emotion without thoughts. Ask yourself, what am I thinking about that's causing this emotional disturbance? What is the activating event that led to this thought?","Ask youself, what am I thinking about that's causing my worry? ",https://vimeo.com/285885756
2,Let's find your 'What if?',"There is no anxiety without thinking about a 'what if' scenario. This is your brain acting out of self-preservation, it's just trying to keep you safe! We only start to feel stress when we believe in, and dwell on, the what-if scenario. Once we believe it's a fact, we then add then ruminate on how 'awful' it is, until you tell yourself: 'I can't stand it."" ",Let's now identify the specific 'What-if' scenarios that you are telling yourself.,https://vimeo.com/362707415
3,"Disputing the ""Awfulizing""","In order to believe it's awful, you must first believe that this made up scenario is also true and inevitable. And then what makes it awful? A fear of judgement, of rejection, of being laughed at or otherwise harmed. The more we accept ourselves fully, and accept what-is, the less these what-if's and hypothetical judgements can affect us. ","Is the what-if scenario actually true? On a scale of 1-100, how awful is it? Why is it not worse?",https://vimeo.com/362725307
4,Let's dispute the 'I can't stand it' statement,"After reading the book, I had a mental breakdown one day. I screamed out loud, "" I can't stand it!"" and immediately my brain went back to Dr. Parr, wow he was right. This is an example of red-flagging. You may find that there are many aspects of life that are so far away from what you wanted that you simply cannot stand it. When you feel that way, remember that you are currently alive, so you've been able to stand it so far...","If you were to have exactly what you wanted, what would that look and feel like? In what ways are you different in that scenario? What are some ways that you can become more like that right now? ",https://vimeo.com/362783278/96a037e66a
6,Breathe Like Your Life Depends On It,"The 4 Blocks Breath is a breathing technique to help you release negative emotions and physiological sensations. Forcing yourself to breathe deeply will ‘hack’ your body into feeling calmer. You may find it difficult to breathe deeply at first because your chest is tight and your muscles are constricted, but the deeper you breathe, the more your body will relax. The act of counting the breaths helps the pattern become symettrical and gradually deeper, watch how with the video button on the top right of this card. ","Remember: Breath is the King of the Mind. If you want to take back control of your mind, it starts by taking control of your breath. Nothing to type here, use the video to do the breath exercise.",https://vimeo.com/288040319
7,Remember to SOS ,"Always remember SOS - self, others, and the situation. Accept your SELF as you are, accept the OTHERS, and accept the SITUATION to the best of your ability. ","Self - In what ways am I rejecting or not accepting aspects of my 'Self'? 
How would it look and feel to forgive and accept yourself fully?

Others - In what ways am I rejecting or not accepting 'Other people or events'?
What are some of the reasons that other people might have done what they did?

Situation - In what ways am I rejecting or not accepting my 'Situation' (circumstances)
Is complaining about the situatino helping? Is it 100% hopeless? Is there anything that can be done to improve the situation?",
8,How do you feel now?,"Think about how you feel now compared to before disputing and breathing. I'm willing to bet it's significantly better, and yet, maybe there's still more. Repeat this process with every block, with every situation that bothers you that you can think of, and do these exercises as many days in a row as you can, and you will gradually steer your life into an entirely new upward spiral. ",Notice the connection between beliefs and how you feel. How do you feel after reframing some of those painful beliefs?,
