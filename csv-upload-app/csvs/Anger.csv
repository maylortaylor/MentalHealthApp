3,How do we replace 'Should's?',"The key to reframing the beliefs that are causing you harm, is to replace the 'shoulds' with a phrase that does not have any resistance, like it ""It would have been better for me if..."" the reason this helps is because it accepts that the unwanted outcome did, in fact, happen. This has a significantly difference psychological effect compared to insisting that it ""should not have happened'. It did happen, and I would have prefered if [blank] had happened instead. ","Take the shoulds from your previous entry and rewrite those events using the phrase ""It would have been better if [blank]""",https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/362134114/5fd352ede3,,anger_for_app_module_2_(egocentric_thinking_)

","What percentage do you honestly feel like you are accepting your should statements? 50%? 60%? Realize that peace comes with 100% acceptance, even of the things we don't like.

6,Breathe like your life depends on it.,"The 4 Blocks Breath is a breathing technique to help you release negative emotions and physiological sensations.
