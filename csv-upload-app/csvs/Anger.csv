1,What's going on?,"Emotions are connected to your thoughts and beliefs. There is no emotion without a thought. Ask yourself, what am I thinking about that's causing this emotional disturbance?

2,Where is your 'Should?',"There is no anger without a 'should, must, or demand' statement. The key to unraveling anger, is to find the 'should' belief, and replace it with acceptance. We'll go into more detail in the next steps, but for now, let's write out what is bothering you and we will then underline all of the 'shoulds'. ",What do you believe should be different about this situation?,https://vimeo.com/362123047,
3,How do we replace 'Should's?',"Let's find those shoulds from your previous entries. The solution is incredibly simple: replace 'should' with 'it would be better.' This is effective because it is not 
that reality is the way it is. When we use a should statement, we are resisting reality which causes cognitive dissonance, which results in our brains creating stress. Think about it, ""it should be different."" How could it be? It's already happened, it can't be different from how it is. Accepting reality will soothe your mind. 

The key to reframing the beliefs that are causing you harm, is to replace the 'shoulds' with a phrase that does not have any resistance, like it ""It would have been better for me if..."" the reason this is better, is because it accepts that the unwanted outcome did, in fact, happen. This has a significantly difference psychological effect compared to insisting that it ""should not have happened'. It did happen, and I woul have prefered if [blank] had happened instead. ","Take the shoulds from your previous entry and rewrite those events using the phrase ""It would have been better if [blank]""",https://vimeo.com/362131397/1ca88005e3,

5,What is egocentric thinking?,"Egocentric Thinking is a way of seeing the world through a lens that says: ""Anything I don’t like, find unpleasant, inconvenient, frustrating, or annoying, should not exist. Anything I do like should spring into existence!"" It assumes that other people should be putting YOU first. We all have egocentric thinking sometimes, but the worse we have it, the worse we feel (and the worse others feel around us)",Write down the ways in which you had an egocentric expectation around this situation? What would this situation look like from the other person's perspectice? What might they have been expecting/desiring?,https://vimeo.com/362129741,
6,Breathe like your life depends on it.,"The 4 Blocks Breath is a breathing technique to help you release negative emotions and physiological sensations. Forcing yourself to breathe deeply will ‘hack’ your body into feeling calmer. You may find it difficult to breathe deeply at first because your chest is tight and your muscles are constricted, but the deeper you breathe, the more your body will relax.

8,How are you feeling now?,"Think about how you feel now compared to before disputing and breathing. I'm willing to bet it's significantly better, and yet, maybe there's still more. Repeat this process with every block, with every situation that bothers you that you can think of, and do these exercises as many days in a row as you can, and you will gradually steer your life into an entirely new upward spiral.
