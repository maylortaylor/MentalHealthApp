1,What's going on?,"Emotions are connected to your thoughts and beliefs. 
There is no emotion without a thought. Ask yourself, what 
am I thinking about that's causing this emotional 
disturbance? What is the activating event that led to this 
thought and feeling? ","Ask yourself, What's happening that triggered 
you?",https://vimeo.com/parrinstitute/creatinganger
2,Where is your 'Should?',"There is no anger without a 'should, must, or demand' 
statement. The key to unraveling anger, is to find the 
should belief, and replace it with acceptance. We'll go 
into more detail in the next steps, but for now, let's write 
out what is bothering you and we will then
underline all of the 'shoulds'. ",What do you believe should be different about this situation?,https://vimeo.com/parrinstitute/angerformula
3,How do we replace 'Should's?',"Let's find those shoulds from your previous entries. The solution is incredibly 
simple: replace 'should' with 'it would be better.' This is effective because it is not 
resisting that reality is the way it is. When we use a should statement, we are 
resisting reality which causes cognitive dissonance, which results in our brains 
creating stress. Think about it, ""it should be different."" How could it be? 
It's already happened, it can't be different from how it is. 
Accepting reality will soothe your mind. 

The key to reframing the beliefs that are causing you harm, is to replace the 'shoulds' with a phrase that does not have any resistance, like it ""It would have been better for me if..."" the reason this is better, is because it accepts that the unwanted outcome did, in fact, happen. This has a significantly difference psychological effect compared to insisting that it ""should not have happened'. It did happen, and I would have prefered if [blank] had happened instead. ","Take the shoulds from your previous entry and rewrite those events using the phrase ""It would have been better if [blank]""",https://vimeo.com/parrinstitute/shoulds
4,Let's take acceptance to the next level,"The level of peace you feel will always equal the amount that you are accepting/rejecting something. People often talk about letting go, the missing ingredient to actually being able to let go of something is through acceptance. ",,https://vimeo.com/parrinstitute/disputinganger

6,Breathe like your life depends on it.,"The 4 Blocks Breath is a breathing technique to help you release negative emotions and physiological sensations. Forcing yourself to breathe deeply will ‘hack’ your body into feeling calmer. You may find it difficult to breathe deeply at first because your chest is tight and your muscles are constricted, but the deeper you breathe, the more your body will relax. The act of counting the breaths helps the pattern become symettrical and gradually deeper, watch how with the video button on the top right of this card. 

Remember: Breath is the King of the Mind. If you want to take back control of your mind, it starts by taking control of your breath.

7,Remember to SOS,"Always remember SOS - self, others, and
the situation. Accept your SELF as you are,
accept the OTHERS, and accept the
SITUATION to the best of your ability. ","Self - In what ways am I rejecting or not accepting aspects of my 'Self'? 
How would it look and feel to forgive and accept yourself fully?

Others - In what ways am I rejecting or not accepting 'Other people or events'?
What are some of the reasons that other people might have done what they did?

Situation - In what ways am I rejecting or not accepting my 'Situation' (circumstances)
Is complaining about the situatino helping? Is it 100% hopeless? Is there anything that can be done to improve the situation?",
8,How are you feeling now?,"Think about how you feel now compared to before disputing and breathing. I'm willing to bet it's significantly better, and yet, maybe there's still more. Repeat this process with every block, with every situation that bothers you that you can think of, and do these exercises as many days in a row as you can, and you will gradually steer your life into an entirely new upward spiral.
