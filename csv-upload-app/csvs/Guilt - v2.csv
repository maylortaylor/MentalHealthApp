1,What's going on?,"There is no emotion without thoughts.
Ask yourself, what am I thinking about 
that's causing this emotional disturbance?
What is the activating event that led to this
thought?","Ask yourself, What's happening that triggered 
you?",
2,Where is your should?,"There is no guilt without an underlying
belief that you SHOULD be perfect. Now 
that you've done this WRONG thing, you
are now WORTH LESS as a person. This is
BS! Behavior does not equal Self worth,
behavior (aka wrongness or mistakes) are
just behavior, they are not your identity. 
Separate your self worth from your 
perceived imperfections. ","Start by writing
down what's bothering you, and then find
your should statements. ",
3,Self Worth is a made up concept!,"How would you feel if you threw away
the concept of self-worth entirely? How 
would it feel to completely accept your
'self' as you are, even if there is behavior 
to improve, your 'Self' is already worthy. ",,
4,How do we replace 'Should's',"Let's find those shoulds from your previous
entries. The solution is incredibly simple:
replace 'should' with 'it would be better.'
This is effective because it is not resisting
that reality is the way it is. When we use a
should statement, we are resisting reality 
which causes cognitive dissonance, which
results in our brains creating stress. Think
about it, ""it should be different."" How could
it be? It's already happened, it can't be 
different from how it is. Accepting reality
will soothe your mind. ",,

6,Breathe Like Your Life Depends On it,"The 4 Blocks Breath is a breathing technique to help you release negative emotions and physiological sensations. Forcing yourself to breathe deeply will ‘hack’ your body into feeling calmer. You may find it difficult to breathe deeply at first because your chest is tight and your muscles are constricted, but the deeper you breathe, the more your body will relax. The act of counting the breaths helps the pattern become symettrical and gradually deeper, watch how with the video button on the top right of this card. 

Remember: Breath is the King of the Mind. If you want to take back control of your mind, it starts by taking control of your breath.

7,SOS,"Always remember SOS - self, others, and
the situation. Accept your SELF as you are,
accept the OTHERS, and accept the
SITUATION to the best of your ability. ","Self - In what ways am I rejecting or not accepting aspects of my 'Self'? 
How would it look and feel to forgive and accept yourself fully?

Others - In what ways am I rejecting or not accepting 'Other people or events'?
What are some of the reasons that other people might have done what they did?

Situation - In what ways am I rejecting or not accepting my 'Situation' (circumstances)
Is complaining about the situatino helping? Is it 100% hopeless? Is there anything that can be done to improve the situation?",
8,How do you feel now?,"Think about how you feel now compared to before disputing and breathing. I'm willing to bet it's significantly better, and yet, maybe there's still more. Repeat this process with every block, with every situation that bothers you that you can think of, and do these exercises as many days in a row as you can, and you will gradually steer your life into an entirely new upward spiral.
